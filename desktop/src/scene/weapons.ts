/**
 * Hand-held arms for the generated warriors.
 *
 * The Meshy figures are unarmed by design (held props break auto-rigging), so
 * every one of them gets a weapon parented to its hand bone. Two sources feed
 * that fist:
 *
 *  - **Primitives**, authored here once per weapon at "figure height = 1" and
 *   cached. This is the right answer for the Dravida and Sun Empire arms, whose
 *   originals nobody can check, and it is the fallback for everything else.
 *  - **Generated sculpts** of the real thing, for the Grande Armée — a
 *   Charleville musket and an An XI cuirassier sword are documented objects, and
 *   a box-and-cylinder version of one reads as a toy. See `scene/armoury.ts`,
 *   which fits each downloaded mesh into the same local frame the primitives are
 *   authored in, so everything downstream (grip, muzzle, pose-driven hold) is
 *   unchanged by the swap.
 *
 * Either way each instance scales the prop by the figure's own height and cancels
 * the bone's accumulated scale/rotation, so it sits in the fist at any pose.

 * How much of the fists' lateral spread a long arm's barrel inherits.

 * Measured on the rigs that actually shoot, that assumption is false: the
 * Grande Armée's aim takes are archery clips, and in them the fists sit side by
 * side **across the chest** — the hand line runs 0.90–1.00 along the figure's
 * lateral axis, leaving almost nothing along its front. Which is bad enough on
 * its own (the musket lay across the man rather than pointing anywhere), but the
 * residue that was being used as the barrel's *direction* also changes sign
 * several times per loop: the line infantry's aim reads front = −0.24, −0.23,
 * +0.27, +0.54, +0.40, −0.22, +0.02, −0.28 across one scan, and its firing clip
 * is at −0.26 on the authored ignition frame. So the musket swung between
 * pointing downrange and pointing back over its owner's shoulder, and the shot
 * was taken from the reversed half.
 *
 * The fists are therefore read for *cant and elevation only*, and the barrel is
