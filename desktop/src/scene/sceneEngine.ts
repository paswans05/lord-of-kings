   * the camera's mean frame-to-frame jerk and spiked it to half a percent of
   * screen height in single frames — a visible shudder on almost every move.
   *
   * So the wall is solved here instead, before anything moves: the rig's ground
   * reach is cut to whatever the hall actually has room for, paid for first out
   * of distance and only then out of elevation. The result is a legal target for
